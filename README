Gitualizer - A visualization for distributed software projects that focuses on overview of code flow. Gitualizer is inspired by gitK and similar visualization tools that try to capture flow of code in multiple parallel branches. 

The project is currently at pre-alpha stage and I am still collecting expert feedback to define the tasks that will be supported. 

Peace!
